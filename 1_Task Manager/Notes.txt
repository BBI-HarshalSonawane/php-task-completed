PHP Assignment: Dynamic Task Management System with Theme PersistenceObjective:
Develop a Dynamic Task Management System using PHP that incorporates task management functionality, theme customization, and the use of sessions and cookies for data persistence and personalization.

Requirements:
Task Management System:

Create a system where users can add, edit, and delete tasks.
Each task should have the following properties:
Task ID (unique, auto-generated).
Task Name (required).
Task Description (optional).
Priority (High, Medium, Low).

Session for Task Storage:

Use PHP $_SESSION to store tasks dynamically during the session.
The tasks should persist only while the session is active.
Cookies for Data Persistence:
Store the last task name added by the user in a cookie and display it on the page.
Use cookies to remember the user's selected theme (light or dark mode) and apply the selected theme automatically upon subsequent visits.

Dynamic Theme Switcher:

Provide a theme switcher on the UI for light and dark themes.
Store the user's selected theme in a cookie with an expiration time of 1 day.

Dynamic UI Generation:

Dynamically generate a table to display the list of tasks.
The table should include actions for editing and deleting tasks.

Form Handling:

Implement a single form to handle both adding and editing tasks.
Prepopulate the form with task data when editing.

Validation and Error Handling:

Validate user inputs for task name and priority using PHP inbuilt methods like filter_var.
Provide appropriate error messages for invalid inputs.

Styling:

Use CSS to style the UI, and ensure the theme switcher dynamically updates the styles.
Bonus: Use inline PHP to embed dynamic styles based on the selected theme.
